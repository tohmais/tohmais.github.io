Hey you. Yeah, you. I'm talking to you. You. The person who clicked on this "init post". Why did you click on this? Curiosity? Are you bored at work and looking at the personal site of some random person you probably saw on social media?



## Developer work  
It'd be nice to do work that mattered to people. I picked a career of air-conditioning and energy-drink-induced overwork. A career that both doesn't feel like it's helping people and also exploits the workers doing the work. Looking at the job market and online doomposting can be anxiety-inducing. Keeping up with the shit trying to take away my job can be anxiety-inducing. Looking at what people online have to say about the superiority complex of STEM students is anxiety inducing.

Slow down. Take a break.

I've got two principles to live by to try and get through this shit surrounding my career. If you follow this, maybe you'll feel a bit better about everything if you're a programmer, too.

1. Don't let some bullshit megacorp try to convince you that this should be your whole life. Don't pretend like it's a requirement to be a programmer to spend all of your weekends doing this. If ever presented with the option of doing so, join (or start!) a union.  

2. Help people. Contribute to open source software that you use! If you can make one user or developer's life a little bit better with something you can contribute, do it! Even if it's something small, you have the power to make other people's lives just that little bit better with what you do. And if you feel like you've done good work, stay steadfast and never doubt the validity or helpfulness of the work you do.
